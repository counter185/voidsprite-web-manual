            <h2>◆Start a network canvas session server</h2>
            <p>
                To start a network canvas session, open an editor workspace and select
                <span class="navbar-hint">File</span> &gt; <span class="navbar-hint">Start network canvas server</span> on the navigation bar.
                <br><br>
                You will have an option to choose your username, user color and the port to use.
                <br><br>
                Click <span class="vsp-button">Confirm</span> to start the server.

                <div class="block-hint">
                    The server will be hosted on all available network interfaces.
                    <br>For a server to be accessible, one of the following conditions must be met:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The server is on the same local network as the client (connected to the same router or network switch)</li>
                        <li>The server is on the same virtual network as the client (like Hamachi or ZeroTier)</li>
                        <li>The server is properly port-forwarded for TCP connections</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="block-hint">
                    <span class="platform platform-windows">◆Windows:</span>
                    <br>When hosting a server for the first time, you will receive a Windows Firewall popup to allow or deny voidsprite to use network sockets.
                    <br>To host or connect to a server, you must allow this, ideally for both private and public connections.
                    <br>If you deny, you must manually allow voidsprite in the Windows Firewall settings.
                </div>
            </p>

            <h2>◆Connect to a network canvas session</h2>
            <p>
                From the <a class="manual-link" href="launchpad.html?back=netcollab">voidsprite Launchpad</a>, select
                <span class="navbar-hint">File</span> &gt; <span class="navbar-hint">Connect to network canvas</span> on the navigation bar.
                <br><br>
                Enter the IP address/hostname and port of the server you want to connect to.

            </p>

            <h3>◆Hostnames and IPv6 addresses</h3>
            <p>
                For easier connection, you can use hostnames instead of IP addresses.
                <br>On Windows local networks, you can use the name of the computer, such as <code>DESKTOP-1234567</code>.

                <br><br>You may also use IPv6 addresses.
